# ☠️ The Scurvy Chronicle ☠️

*Gaming news, shouted by a drunk pirate with a broken keyboard.*

Welcome aboard The Scurvy Chronicle, a web application for the discerning pirate who needs their gaming news delivered with all the subtlety of a cannonball. This project is a demonstration of a modern React application built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, all wrapped in a brutalist, pirate-themed design.

We believe in loud design, unfiltered opinions, and zero QA testing. These pages be scrawled in grog and guesswork.
